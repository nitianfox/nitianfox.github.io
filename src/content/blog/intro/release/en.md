This project is currently under active maintenance. To update, follow these steps:

First, verify the version number in `package.json` or review the changelog here or at [Release](https://github.com/Motues/Momo/releases).

The project version number is only incremented when the configuration file structure undergoes structural changes. Project configuration files refer to those related to website layout and content, including `astro.config.mjs`, `src/config.ts`, `src/content.config.ts`, and files within the `src/i18n/` folder.

Blog text, images, and other content are stored in the `src/content/`, `src/assets`, and `public` folders.

## Version Number Unchanged

You can directly clone this project, then overwrite the new project with your original configuration files. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies, followed by `pnpm build` for local compilation. Finally, execute `pnpm preview` to preview the compiled project.

When updating inside this repository, run `pnpm momo update`: it reads the latest [release](https://github.com/Motues/Momo/releases), compares it with the version in `package.json`, downloads that version's source, **keeps your own posts and images** (`src/content`, `src/assets`, `public`) and `src/config.ts`, overwrites the rest of the code, **deletes files the new version no longer ships** and installs dependencies, then lists the **configuration files that need to be merged by hand**. Deletion only covers files that existed in the previous template but were removed upstream (tracked in `.momo/manifest.json`; the first update reads the file list of your current version tag instead), so files you added yourself are never touched, and deleted files are backed up next to the overwritten ones under `.backup/update-<timestamp>/overwritten/`. Run `pnpm momo update --dry-run` first to preview the changes, add `--no-delete` to only overwrite, and `pnpm momo restore <backup name>` rolls the configuration back.

## Version Number Changed

Whenever the version number changes, the modification log will be updated here. Refer to the specific log entries to modify the corresponding configuration files.

Below are general modification suggestions.

* **`astro.config.mjs` Modifications**: Typically just overwrite the file. Its `site` and `i18n` fields are read from `siteConfig.rootSiteUrl`, `i18nConfig.defaultLanguage` and `i18nConfig.supportedLanguages` in `src/config.ts`.
* **`config.ts` Modifications**: Update `config.ts` by adding or modifying configuration items as required.
* **`content.config.ts` Modifications**: Typically involves adding new frontmatter configurations to articles. Add the required new configuration items to articles as specified.
* **`src/i18n/` Modifications**: Generally involves adding new internationalization translations; simply overwrite the files. Note that the Cover text of each page (`cover.title` / `cover.subTitle`) has moved into `i18nConfig.translations` in `src/config.ts` — edit it there.

## Version Information

> Version numbers follow the `YY.MM.DD` format

### 26.10.1

> Happy National Day!

* **New photo cover**: the first page of the home page uses a full-screen photo as its background, with the `Cover` title and subtitle centered and enlarged on top of an adjustable black mask; scrolling down smoothly moves the title back to its place, restores its size and colour, and fades the photo into a faint backdrop. Later pagination pages plus the archive / about / friends and post pages all get a very faint version of the photo as their background, and its blurred placeholder is generated at build time — nothing to prepare by hand
* **In-site navigation no longer reloads the page**: [swup](https://swup.js.org/) now handles client-side routing with the same fade as before, plus hover preloading and "back / forward returns to the same spot"; the header / footer / search modal are no longer rebuilt on navigation, and the language menu and active nav state follow the current address
* **The page scrollbar is now [OverlayScrollbars](https://kingsora.github.io/OverlayScrollbars/)**: it floats above the content, hides itself automatically, supports dragging the handle and clicking the track, and follows the theme in both light and dark mode; the search result list uses it too
* **Reworked desktop navigation pill**: nothing but text and the active-page highlight at the top, growing an outline and frosted glass once it docks; with the photo cover it now transitions along the scroll progress instead of switching the moment you scroll
* **The mobile drawer now highlights the current page and filters by category**: the current page gets a background and the accent colour, and the category chips filter the archive page — clicking the selected one again clears the filter
* **Improved link styling in posts**: thinner underlines that sit slightly higher and turn theme blue together with the text on hover; the arrow icon of new-tab links is smaller and changes colour along with the link
* **New config**: `siteConfig.theme.photoCover` (switch / photo path / mask) and `siteConfig.theme.overlayScrollbars` (switch / auto-hide / thickness), editable in `src/config.ts` or in the CMS; new translation `button.scrollDown`
* **CLI**: `pnpm momo update` now also removes files that no longer exist in the new version (add `--no-delete` to only overwrite), `pnpm momo clean` also clears `node_modules/.astro`, and `pnpm momo doctor` flags a leftover `<ClientRouter />`
* A batch of bugs that only surfaced with client-side routing are fixed: broken browser back, the header font flashing after a navigation, out-of-sync TOC and header highlighting, console warnings, and more
* This update modifies the config files `astro.config.mjs` (client-side navigation now uses swup), `src/config.ts` (two new theme switches) and `src/i18n/` (a new `button.scrollDown` translation) — merge them as prompted

### 26.9.29

* New **new-tab link syntax**: put `{target="_blank"}` straight after a link to open it in a new tab, with an arrow icon appended after the link; only `target` / `rel` / `class` are recognised, `rel` always keeps `noopener` / `noreferrer`, and links holding only an image get no icon
* **Reworked content link styling**: links now carry a thin solid underline and turn theme-blue with slight transparency on hover, and the link colour follows its container (so syntax with a colour of its own, such as blockquotes or rainbow text, wins)
* **Image lightbox zoom improvements**: the lightbox opens at 86% on desktop (100% on mobile) and double-click / image switching / the "default scale" button all return to that baseline; fly-in and fly-out use the unscaled, untranslated rect so the animation starts exactly on the thumbnail, and switching images while zoomed no longer jumps back to the default scale first
* Every remark / rehype plugin under `src/plugins/` **moved from `.mjs` to `.ts`** (proper types, trimmed comments), and relative imports between plugins now need an explicit `.ts` extension; the CMS preview loads `.ts` natively in Node, so it needs **Node ≥ 22.18**
* Removed the obsolete `script/newpost.js` and the `pnpm newpost` script (it wrote frontmatter with the long out-of-date `date` / `slug` fields; create posts with `pnpm momo new` or the CMS instead)
* This update modifies the configuration files `astro.config.mjs` (plugin imports use `.ts`) and `package.json` (adds the `@types/hast`, `@types/mdast`, `@types/unist`, `@types/node` and `vfile` dev-dependencies and drops the `newpost` script); overwrite them, run `pnpm install`, and delete the leftover `.mjs` / `.js` files in `src/plugins/`

### 26.9.27

* The collage row height is now **computed per row**: the widest image (largest aspect ratio) decides it and is shown in full, while the other images of the row are cropped to that height
* Collages **no longer show the caption under each image**; the lightbox now reads the image `title` instead
* The collage reads image aspect ratios at build time: relative paths and `/public` paths are read from disk, while remote images are fetched as a header only (512 KB max, 5 s timeout, 6 concurrent); on failure the row height comes from the other images
* The **lightbox can now shrink images down to 50%**, and the matching buttons are disabled at 50% and 800%
* `pnpm momo update` no longer updates `.github`, `.vscode` or `.idea`
* Fixed cover images with an uppercase extension (e.g. `.JPG`) not being found
* This update only changes `astro.config.mjs` (the collage gained the `public` directory lookup), so simply overwrite it

### 26.9.26

* New **automatic image collage**: consecutive images in the content are laid out as a grid and still open full size in the lightbox
* `pnpm momo update` is now **release-based**: it no longer depends on local git and keeps your own posts, images and `src/config.ts`
* Front-end smoothness work: reduced the home page's blocking stylesheet and fixed the listener pile-up and the entrance animation dying after a client-side navigation
* New `pnpm momo audit` command for re-measuring the first-paint cost of a build
* The CMS "Site config" page gained the collage switch and the per-row limit
* This update modifies the `src/config.ts` configuration file by adding the `theme.imageCollage` field; you must add this new field when updating, while every other file can simply be overwritten

### 26.9.25

* Code blocks switched to the official **Expressive Code** integration, with title bars, line highlighting, diff markers, line numbers, collapsible sections and a copy button; the switch and code theme live in `siteConfig.expressiveCode` in `src/config.ts`
* The image lightbox is now self-built (no longer depending on `photoswipe`): wheel / button / double-click / pinch zoom, drag to pan, arrow keys or swipe to switch, Esc to close, with fly-in and fly-out animations
* The CMS gained a "Site config" page (`#/config`) for editing `src/config.ts` visually; the archive page is now server-rendered
* SEO improvements: canonical, hreflang, Open Graph / Twitter Cards, structured data, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
* This update modifies the `astro.config.mjs` configuration file, adds the new config file `ec.config.mjs` and adds `siteConfig.expressiveCode` to `src/config.ts`; it also changes the dependencies (adds `astro-expressive-code`, removes `photoswipe`), so add the new fields and run `pnpm install` when updating

### 26.9.10

> This update contains **breaking configuration changes**. Please read the release notes below carefully!
