Momo originates from Xiaohongshu's 📕, serving as every new user's initial nickname, symbolizing a fresh start. The blog's design philosophy stems from this concept, beginning with simplicity to strike a balance between complex functionality and minimalist aesthetics.

## ✨ Features

* **Minimalist Design**: Clean page layout with black and white as primary colors, accented by blue
* **Dark Mode**: Supports manual switching or automatic system adaptation
* **Mobile Adaptation**: Components optimized for mobile devices, delivering the same experience as desktop browsers
* **Image experience**: Click any image to open the lightbox; consecutive images are automatically laid out as a grid; images inside posts support an LQIP gradient placeholder
* **Extensive Markdown syntax**: KaTeX, Typst (compiled to SVG at build time), Alert components, GitHub / NetEase Music cards, quote component, ruby annotations, spoilers, rainbow text, underline, new-tab links, Expressive Code and more
* **Local search**: Localized search built with [pagefind](https://pagefind.app/), no external service required
* **Internationalization (i18n)**: Supports multilingual switching, currently available in Simplified Chinese and English
* **Commenting**: Supports local deployment and Cloudflare deployment. See [Backend](https://github.com/Motues/Momo-Backend) for details
* **SEO**: canonical URLs, hreflang alternates, Open Graph / Twitter Cards, structured data, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
* **Local CMS**: Start it with `pnpm cms` to edit posts with live preview (sharing the same Markdown pipeline as the blog) instead of editing Markdown by hand
* **Command line tool**: `pnpm momo` provides config backup/restore, one-command updates, new post creation and environment checks
* **TypeScript**: The site source and the custom `src/plugins/` pipeline are both written in TypeScript
* Other core features: Article categories, directory, RSS subscription, text statistics, reading time

## 🚀 Quick Start

> Requirements: Node.js **>= 22** (24 LTS recommended; the local CMS needs **>= 22.18**) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

1. Clone this project
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Motues/Momo.git
    cd Momo
    ```
2. Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies (use `npm install -g pnpm` to install `pnpm`)
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server

## 🔧 Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration Guide](./config_en.md). For detailed information, visit [Momo](https://momo.motues.top/en/intro/config) and read the corresponding articles.

Site information, theme switches, languages and the Cover text of each page are configured in `src/config.ts`; the `site` and `i18n` fields of `astro.config.mjs` read from that file automatically.

## 📚 Updating

Refer to the [Update Guide](./release_en.md) for instructions on updating your project. Visit [Momo](https://momo.motues.top/en/intro/release) for detailed information.

Run `pnpm momo update` to do it automatically: it checks the GitHub releases, downloads the new source, backs up, overwrites the code, deletes files the new version no longer ships and installs dependencies, then lists the config files that need manual merging. Your own posts and images (`src/content`, `src/assets`, `public`) and `src/config.ts` are always kept; deletion only covers files that existed in the previous template but were removed upstream (tracked in `.momo/manifest.json`, so files you added yourself are never touched — add `--no-delete` to keep them and only overwrite). Add `--dry-run` to preview the changes without writing anything.

## 🍃 Branch

Below are some branches that are maintained on an irregular basis; we cannot guarantee that they will remain in sync with the `main` branch.

* `memos`: Implements the Memos card feature
* `v5`: Version v5—no longer supported
